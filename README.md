## Project Summary
This is a tiny project for organising some messy files in the "Photos" directory.   

## About The Project
The "Photos" directory has some .jpg files. But the file names are quite a mess!
So the python code aims to rearrange the files into directories that have the names
of places where the photos were taken. It factors in how the files were named and how
to cut the strings of file names appropriately using functions and creating directories
based on them. This automates the whole "let's make a file one at a time in GUI and
copy paste the files" very efficiently.


## How To Run The Project
1. Open up a Terminal.
2. cd into the 'organise-photos' directory.
3. Run the python script using 'python3 organise_photos.py' command in the Terminal.
4. And make sure to have the directory's GUI open to see the magic happen.
5. The zip file contains "Photos" directory, so that you can see the automation happen
   again!
